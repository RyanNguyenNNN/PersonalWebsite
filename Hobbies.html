	<h3>Coding & Math Related Things</h3>
	<p>Recently I've enjoyed learning more about coding. Currently, I know basic knowledge on Python and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. It's still relatively new but I hope to create more things with them soon. 
	<br>Also I tend to enjoy a lot of math related stuff so if anything interesting passes by I like exploring it.</p>
	
	<h3>Anime/TV Shows</h3>
	<p>As a kid, I liked watching TV Shows and Anime. In recent years, there aren't a lot of TV Shows I watch but over covid I was able to explore some new anime series I likely wouldn't have.</p>
	
	<h3>Reading/Writing/Drawing</h3>
	<p>While these three things are three different activities, I'm grouping them together since it's some things I do every now and then, and hope to start more of. Of the <br>three, I'm the worst at drawing and hope to improve that in the future.</p>
	
	<h3>Sleeping</h3>
	<p>Not everyone counts sleep as a hobby, but I do.</p>
