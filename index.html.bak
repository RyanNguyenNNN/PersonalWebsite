<p>
I enjoy a multipide of things, especially sleep- but if you want to hear about a more non-basic activiity, then it would be I like watching tv shows which for the most part is just anime series. I'm also trying to draw more often, and learn more about it. 
I'm pretty bad at it, but I hope to learn more. 
<br/>
	<p>Also in the meantime, I'm using the "ALl Real Numbers" symbol as my logo, since mostly I don't have another logo- but also since I enjoy a lot of math related things.</p>

	<p>Also my email is rnguyen20@bostonk12.org</p>
